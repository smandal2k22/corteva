I have used Python Flask Framework to spin up a POC app for the project.
This project requires pandas package (external) to manipulate the text data and insert into the DB.
I could have used Python in-built file read/write operations to read the data and insert into DB.

The DB I have used is sqlite, for it being easiest to work with for POCs in my opinion.

Additional things I want to add is ->
The APIs that I have created can take 4 params
    date
    station -> I used txt file name as station
    page_num, page_size for pagination purposes

I could have achieved both endpoints working on same one to avoid code duplucation but I did it the otherway as mentioned in the test.

I have not used configuratin file at all, given the size of the project but all the DB details, Basic Auth details for the APIs,
port num where the app ll run. log file path, DB table name/details can be put inside confile file
and the app can fetch from it instead of hardcoded way that is in the POC.

In terms of deployment:
I think you would spin up EC2 Instance in AWS, write AMI script to install Python and create virtual env that the app ll run.
The Script ll install all the necessary libraries from requirements.txt and run the app.
We could introduce some keepalive endpoint just to check if the app is running or not, and in case of not running, auto-scale could spin up new instance.
